# Closing Remarks

The process of building NovaScript has been a very fun task for me to do. I always pushed myself
everyday to improve this language with a goal of at least 3 contributions whether it was raising issues,
submitting PRs or plain old commit and pushes. This journey has been a very insightful start for the 
forefront of my Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence career.

With all that happiness I leave NovaScript on its own journey, I ask it to discover its own
bugs (there are a lot) and to squash them. One day maybe NovaScript will find itself in its 
first stable release, running and replacing legacy code on many worldwide systems. At the very
least, I hope to have raised NovaScript enough to make at least one more developer happy while
they write code. Perhaps in days long after me, the last NovaScript code on any machine will
have been truly lived to its highest potential.

As I grow and my attention shifts towards other projects, I will always remember the chance
at changing the world this language had given me.
