# Closing Remarks

Creating NovaScript has been the most joyful and meaningful journey of my life. I always pushed myself
everyday to improve this language with a goal of at least 3 contributions whether it was raising issues,
submitting PRs or committing and pushing. This journey has been a very insightful start for the 
forefront of my Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence career.

With all that, I leave NovaScript on its own journey, I leave it in the hands of time, asking it to discover its own
bugs (there are many) and to squash them, to evolve beyond what I initially envisioned. Perhaps one day, 
NovaScript will reach its 
first stable release, running in production and replacing legacy code globally.
Or maybe, at the very least, it will bring joy to just one more developer who finds
inspiration in writing code with it.

As I grow and my attention shifts towards other projects, I will always remember 
that NovaScript
wasn’t just about writing code; it was about building something that mattered. I will forever remember the happiness when
the code worked, frustration when the code didn't work and the strange feeling that
one day this would turn out be something bigger than myself.
