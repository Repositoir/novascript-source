# NovaScript Windows Setup

## Running by PowerShell

There is a file named `run.ps1` which will execute the same as an `npm dev run` but with
more version and software checks. This is a skeletal form of the executable that is to be
made for windows execution of NovaScript.

### Execution

```powershell
powershell.exe .\path\to\run.ps1
```
